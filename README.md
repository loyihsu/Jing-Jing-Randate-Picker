# Jing-Jing Randate Picker

Pick a date for Jing-Jing!

## How it works?

* The dates in the year are mapped with an array.
* The input date string would be parsed to find out the starting and ending date for the random picker.
* The random picker picks a number between the starting and ending date, indicating the date picked.
* The date is then translated into the human readable form.
* **The Picker only works in the same year with a continous range.** Leap year can be switched on with the  `leapyear` Bool.

## How to run it?
